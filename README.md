## SynopsisGrandma wants to store all of her family recipes, but keeps losing her old recipe book. We're brinding grandma into the digital age by building her a web app where she can keep her recipes on the web!### Grandma Requirements: [ 1 ] Grandma can add new recipes through browser [ 2 ] Grandma can edit an existing recipe through browser [ 3 ] Grandma can remove an existing recipe through browser [ 4 ] Provide an endpoint to list all saved recipes in JSON format### Solution:!["Logo"][logo]#### Ruby on rails 5[logo]: http://www.busation.com/assets/ror-3e6d1bb522b24da81044506358d758bc.jpg "Logo"##### why?: '+' easy to start'+' include all required functionality out-of-box'+' lot's of libraries for additional features'+' great open-source community'+' massive documentation##### trade-offs:'-' 65 files were automatically generated to support 1 model with CRUD and 1 api endpoint### Further improvements:1. Authorisation and authentication.     *cause we don't want anyone else post or delete Grandma recipes*     **potential solution**: [Device gem](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) & [Cancancan gem](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)2. Ability to add photos.         *to illustrate recipe*        **potential solution**: [Rails 5 module Active storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) or [Carrierwave gem](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave)3. Ability to add comments and likes.        *cause we love our Granny and want to share our appreciation*        **potential solution**:     1) add to Recipe model one-to-many relation with Comment model    2) add to Recipe model one-to-many relation with Like model4. Tag cloud.        *to ease search process - Granny has many recipes*        **potential solution**: [act-as-tagable-on gem](https://github.com/mbleigh/acts-as-taggable-on)5. More tests.        *after adding more features*        **potential solution**: [Rspec-rails gem](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) & [Capybara gem](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara)
